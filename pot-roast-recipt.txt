Ingredients:
- 1 (3 to 4-pound) boneless bottom round roast
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2 yellow onions, peeled and quartered
- 3 cloves garlic, smashed
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 cup red wine
- 2 cups beef stock
- 2 fresh thyme sprigs
- 2 bay leaves
- 3 carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch pieces
- Freshly chopped parsley leaves, for garnish


Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

2. Season the roast on all sides with salt and pepper.

3. In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat the vegetable 
	oil and sear the roast on all sides. Add the onions, 
	garlic and tomato paste and cook until slightly colored. 
	Add the wine, stock, thyme and bay leaves. Bring the 
	liquid to a simmer, cover, and place in the oven.

4. Roast for 1 1/2 hours and then add the carrots. Continue to 
	cook for 1 more hour. Transfer the roast to a cutting 
	board and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes. Slice and place 
	on a serving platter. Skim the fat off the braising 
	liquid and serve with the roast. Garnish with parsley.
